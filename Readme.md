#Practical Machine Learning
Coursera's Data Science Specialization, Practical Machine Learning's project

###Background
Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement - a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. 

The goal of this project is to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm and dumbell of 6 participants. People were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways.

###Project's scope
The goal of the project is to predict the manner in which people do the exercise, create a report describing how to build the model, how to use cross validation, what the expected out of sample error is, and why make the choices. Then use the prediction model to predict 20 different test cases.
